# Q: A World of Warcraft User Interface

I'm tired of running two dozen separate addons that each customize a single
part of the interface to my liking. So I'm scrapping all the cruft and
building my own UI.

Zero config. BYOUF (bring your own unit frames).

## Features:

* Action bars
* Minimap
* Chat Layout
* Inserts Calibri and Minimalist into a number of media libraries.

### Not Implemented:

* Player, Target, Target's Target and Focus frames
* Raid/Party Frames
* Buffs, Cast bars

### TODO:

* Pet & Possess Bars

## Known Issues:

* Bonus bar is transparent until I get the textures there worked out.
* Class bar isn't handled gracefully
