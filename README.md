# A World of Warcraft User Interface

I'm tired of running two dozen separate addons that each customize one part of
the interface to my liking. So I'm scrapping all the cruft and building my UI.

Zero config. Embeds [oUF](http://ixo.no/git/oUF.git/).

## Features:

* Player, Target, Target's Target and Focus frames
* Casting bars
* Action bars
* Minimap
* Chat Layout
* Inserts Calibri and Minimalist into a number of media libraries.

## Not Yet Implemented:

* Raid/Party Frames
* Pet / Posses Bar
* Buffs

### Issues:

* Bonus bar is transparent until I get the textures there worked out.
* Class bar isn't handled gracefully
